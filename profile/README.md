    <i>Castor is a <strong><abbr title="Developer eXperience">DX</abbr> oriented task
    runner</strong> built in PHP featuring a range of functions for common task processing.</i>
</p>

It can be viewed as an alternative to Makefile, Fabric, Invoke, Shell scripts,
etc., but it leverages PHP's scripting capabilities and its extensive library ecosystem.

It comes with many features to make your life easier:

* Seamless parsing of **arguments and options**, simplifying input handling
* **[Autocomplete](https://castor.jolicode.com/going-further/interacting-with-castor/autocomplete)** support for faster and error-free typing
* A built-in list of useful functions:
    * [`run()`](https://castor.jolicode.com/getting-started/run/#the-run-function): Runs external processes, enabling seamless integration with external tools
    * [`io()`](https://castor.jolicode.com/going-further/helpers/console-and-io/#the-io-function): Displays beautiful output and interacts with the terminal
    * [`watch()`](https://castor.jolicode.com/going-further/helpers/watch/): Watches files and automatically triggers actions on file modifications
    * [`fs()`](https://castor.jolicode.com/going-further/helpers/filesystem/#the-fs-function): Creates, removes, and manipulates files and directories
    * [And even more advanced functions](https://castor.jolicode.com/reference/)
